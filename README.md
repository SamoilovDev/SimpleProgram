# SimpleProgram
This is a simple console program that accepts numbers as input or from a file
(depending on what you set in the first parameter) and prints even or even/odd numbers of all received numbers to the console
if there is no second parameter or to the file if the second parameter is given.
An example of input for the program to work:
application4 output.txt
application input.txt output.txt
application 4
application input.txt
